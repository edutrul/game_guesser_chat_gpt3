I did this for fun with @david.jeyachandran since he asked me hey Eduardo I want to create a quick game and need 45 minutes for doing pair programming. The requeriments were:

- Guess the country name from an image country
- Simple and easy
- Any programming language

And I said ok code all of this in 45 minutes given it is Saturday night, I am in pijamas watching crunchyroll and said ok let's do it, I was thinking about WebDev, react but hey Eduardo you've got 45 minutes so I said hey chatGpt so I asked Chat GPT hey "Build me a guess game from country image, guess the country name having 4 country name choices." and I got below code

I deployed locally and worked! (of course it is not fully 100% so I added a little bit to get all country names and images but chatgpt3 made my 99% of the game! I added a little bit of documentation and asked chatGPT to write in javascript

Then asked to add some styles:

and finally added a logic to refresh the page wether or not I answered correctly.

I am documentin all this process and submitted the repository free for access to everyone https://github.com/edutrul/game_guesser_chat_gpt3 

I hope you feel inspire and I you want a full session of this in a webinar let me know and will do it.
